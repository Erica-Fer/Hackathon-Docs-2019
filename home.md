## Welcome to the documentation for UWB Hacks 2019!

Here you can find guides and information that you may want to know before the event begins so that you can show up prepared.

## How to Submit Your Project

You've done well to make it to the end of the day. We can't wait to see what you've been working on
and I'm sure you are excited to share your projects.

Project presentations will begin at 9:15 PM. You'll have about 3 minutes to demo
(might change depending on the number of people). Do whatever you feel best represents your project.
We can pull up your project's site or repo, but we recommend that you bring a laptop up if you have HDMI or VGA.

Present your project to recieve an "I Demoed" keychain!

Please have the following information ready:

- Project Name
- Team Name
- Team Members (MAX 5, ONE SUBMISSION PER TEAM)
- Project Description
- Project Links/Website/GitHub Repo
- Links to Screenshots on GitHub

1. [First, submit your project here. https://forms.gle/UkxpL96C3pWS4boB7](https://forms.gle/UkxpL96C3pWS4boB7)
2. Then, post about your project using our template on Discord. Check out other projects while you are at it.
3. Volunteer for presentations starting at 9:15 PM.

Once everyone has demoed, we'll open up a survey where you can vote on the student favorite.
The judges will deliberate and choose the winners of each of the other awards.
Awards will be presented at the end.

Good luck!

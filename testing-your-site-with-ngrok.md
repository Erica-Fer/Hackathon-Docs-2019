# This documentation is still WIP

[ngrok][ngrok] is a tool for testing your website
with a public-facing URL.
You can use it to test on mobile, share with your friends,
and set up webhooks.

It's a great tool for hackathons because of how quickly it
can be set up.

## When to use ngrok

- when testing your app that isn't hosted with static pages

## When not to use ngrok

- when developing a site that is purely static content (there are better options)
- when you already have a server to test on (ngrok has rate limits)

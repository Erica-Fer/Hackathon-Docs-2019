Congratulations on making it to the hackathon! The hosts, organizers, and participants are very excited to see what kind of creative ideas you and your teammates come up with.

_"But what if I don't have an idea?"_, you ask. The event organizers have a list of creative web development project concepts that you are welcome to draw inspiration from.

### Solve a Community Problem

Is there an aspect of student life or community life that is neglected or underserved? If you think the answer is "yes", you probably have a great project idea!

Here's a few suggestions to get you started:

- Textbook exchange website
- Student-sourced events website for your school
- Study buddy finder
- Carpool buddy finder
- Course syllabus database site
- Resource website for community members that are food-insecure

### Build a Site for a Technical Topic

Where would we be without sites like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)? Somebody came up with that idea, and you could build the next great toolkit for technically-inclined folks all over the world.

For example, a great website could provide:

- Interactive documentation for the Motorola 68k microprocessor architecture (or another technology of your choice)
- Browser-based data visualization for a dataset on [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
- Interactive coding challenges
- A resume grammar validator and/or parser
- Template engines for portfolio websites

### Create Something Silly

A fun project can make your hackathon experience that much better! Here are a few ideas for inspiration:

- A simple online game _(Check out [agar.io](https://agar.io/index.html), for example)_
- A website exclusively inspired by a randomly generated GitHub repository name _(How about `supreme-potato`, `bug-free-guide`, or `ideal-octo-meme`? What does GitHub suggest when you create a new repository?)_
- A wiki for memes
- SaaSquatch _(But what is that, you ask? We have no clue! What do you think it should be?)_
- Automated image modulation _(Check out [this website](https://deepfriedmemes.com/) for an implementation example)_

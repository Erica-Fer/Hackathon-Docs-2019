In order to get your website deployed, you will need to create and configure a machine to do that. This page has all the information you need to create and configure a Digital Ocean droplet to host your website.
_Note:_ you are welcome to use any cloud provider you are comfortable with. Setting up a machine on Digital Ocean is fast and easy, but you can use AWS, Azure, or any other service provider you prefer. Please note that the technical advisors at the hackathon may not be able to help you troubleshoot account issues for the provider you choose to go with.

## Step 0: Create an Account on Digital Ocean

- Create an account on [Digital Ocean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new). You will need three pieces of information to register:
  - Your name (individual or team name)
  - A valid email address
  - A password for your account
- You will receive a confirmation email after registering; click the confirmation link to finalize account creation.
- After clicking the confirmation link, you will be taken to a billing page. Please have a credit or debit card ready to link to your new account. _Note: this is a common requirement for all service providers; note that you can suspend services to limit your charges at any time._
- Next, you will be prompted to create a project. 
  - Make sure you give your project a sweet name! 
  - For the **What is your project for?** question, you can select whichever category you prefer. We recommend _Class project / Educational purposes_, but you may prefer _Web Application_, _Website or blog_, _Service or API_, or _Other_.
  - For the deployment tools section of this page, you can select anything you know you will be using; when in doubt, skip this step.
- TODO :bug: :bug: :bug: address adding credits to account (if we end up doing this)
